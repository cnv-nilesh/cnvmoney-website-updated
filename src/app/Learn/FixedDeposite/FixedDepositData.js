      " Difference Between Corporate Fixed Deposits and Bank Fixed Deposits",
    info: `Fixed Deposits are one of India's favorite investments, and
              most investors mark it as one of the safest and best investments,
              but why is there a line between bank FD's and Corporate FD
              's? What are the differences that make the investors think
              before choosing any particular type of fixed deposit? Fixed
              Deposits are one of the safe investments that offer risk-free and
              guaranteed returns. Not limited to banks, Corporates also offer
              fixed deposits and are generally for a shorter period.`,

    header: "Rate of Interest",
    info: `One of the biggest factors before choosing any type of investment
              is how much returns the investor will make; this factor also
              resides with fixed deposits in the form of Rate of Interest. Banks
              offer an average rate of interest contrary to corporate fixed
              deposits. If one has invested in corporate fixed deposits over
              banks, they can expect a higher and guaranteed interest rate over
              the tenure. Another reason one should invest in corporate fixed
              deposits is that most of them offer both cumulative and
              non-cumulative interest-based payouts. In cumulative interest
              payout, the interest is reinvested, leading to a better payout,
              compounding returns.`,

    header: "Risk Investment",
    info: `Before investing, a wise decision is to analyze the risk and how
              much risk can be afforded. Fixed deposits are safe investments,
              but they do involve risks though in the longer run. Corporate
              fixed deposits are unsecured, and there is always a doubt of the
              company collapsing. Meaning, corporate fixed deposits are risky,
              but one of the benefits is market changes do not influence them.
              On the contrary, bank fixed deposits are secured investments and
              low in risk. Besides, RBI covers security up to 1 Lakh rupees on
              fixed deposits on each. In certain cases, the numbers are up to 5
              Lakhs.`,

    header: "Premature Withdrawal Penalty",
    info: `In most instances, when there is an emergency or need for funds,
              people think of withdrawing fixed deposits. The problem with
              premature withdrawal is banks and corporates both penalize for
              withdrawing before the tenure is completed. If both the financial
              institutions penalize for premature withdrawal, then which should
              be a better option? It is the bank fixed deposit. The reason for
              this is bank charges around 1-2% on the interest for premature
              withdrawing. The case with corporates is totally different. First,
              not all corporates offer premature withdrawal before the three
              months to six months from the investment date. If there is a
              premature withdrawal from corporates that offer, then no interest
              accrues on the deposit. Withdrawing after six to twelve months,
              certain companies charge a penalty of 2-3 percent.`,

    header: "Taxation",
    info: ` Do fixed deposits incur taxes? Yes, they do, but there are certain
              tax benefits that one must know before investing in fixed
              deposits. Which is the best Fixed Deposit for tax saving? Is it
              bank FDs or corporate FDs? It is the bank fixed deposit because
              many banks with a lock-in period can save in taxes. If the lock-in
              period is for five to ten years, there is a tax benefit under 80C
              of the income tax act. However, there are a few conditions. If the
              fixed deposit is withdrawn before the lock-in period or the
              interest rate is beyond Rs. 10,000, then the bank cuts the tax
              directly from the source.`,

    header: " Final Words",
    info: ` These are the major differences between bank fixed deposits and
              corporate fixed deposits. There are good tax benefits on bank FDs,
              while corporate FDs are a great choice for a higher interest rate
              and cumulative-based interest. If money is not stable in your
              pocket and the expenses are more, don't go for the corporate
              FDs as they have a higher penalty for premature withdrawals.
              Tenure wise, Bank Fixed Deposits are great as they offer a longer
              tenure, and when the tenure is long, one can expect interests for
              a long time which is not true with corporate fixed deposits as
              they are only available up to 5 years and no longer than it.
              Overall, both are the best investments in Fixed Deposits but
              choosing the right fixed deposit is based gon the investor's
              goal.`,
