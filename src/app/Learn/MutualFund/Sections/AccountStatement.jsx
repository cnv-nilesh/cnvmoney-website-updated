        Within how much time a person should receive the Account Statement?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mutual funds are required to dispatch certificates or statements of
        accounts within six weeks from the date of closure of the initial
        subscription of the scheme. In case of close-ended schemes, the
        investors would get either a demat account statement or unit
        certificates as these are traded in the stock exchanges. In case of
        open-ended schemes, a statement of account is issued by the mutual fund
        within 30 days from the date of closure of initial public offer of the
        scheme. The procedure of repurchase is mentioned in the offer document

      <h1>Can I get my account statement and other communication on email?</h1>

      <h1>I have multiple accounts in a fund. Can I consolidate?</h1>
      <p>

        for consolidation is that all static details like Address, Bank, Mode of
        Holding; Unit holders etcâ€¦ have to be identical across all accounts in a
