      </h1>
      <p>
        Yes, you can switch between schemes/investment options/plans. You need
        to complete a transaction slip, which you can download from website or
        detach from the bottom of your account statement. A switch from one
        scheme to the other is treated as redemption from the scheme from where
        it is switched out & a purchase into the scheme into which it is being
        switched. Thus you will be liable for any &apos;applicable&apos; entry load, exit
        load, or CDSC
      </p>
      <h1>What is a lock-in period for my units?</h1>
      <p>
        Lock-in period is a time span during which the money invested cannot be

        however in the case of tax saving funds a minimum lock-in period of 3
        years is applicable.
      </p>
      <h1>What is a Switch?</h1>
      <p>
        Some Mutual Funds provide investor with an option to shift his
        investment from one scheme to another within that fund this option is
        known as switching. <br />
        Investors can opt to switch units between Dividend Plan and Growth Plan
        at NAV based prices. Switching is also allowed into/from open-ended
        schemes currently within the Fund family or schemes that may be launched
        in the future at NAV based prices. <br />
        While switching between Debt and Equity Schemes, one has to take care of
        exit and entry loads. Switching from a Debt Scheme to Equity scheme
        involves an entry load while the vice versa does not involve an entry
        load. <br />
        Switches are subject to loads depending upon the Scheme details
      </p>
      <h1>Is there a limit to transfer of money from one scheme to another?</h1>

        What are Growth / Equity Oriented SchemeWhat are Growth / Equity
        Oriented Scheme
      </h1>
      <p>
        The aim of growth funds is to provide capital appreciation over the
        medium to long- term. Such schemes normally invest a major part of their
        corpus in equities. Such funds have comparatively high risks. These
        schemes provide different options to the investors like dividend option,
        capital appreciation, etc. and the investors may choose an option
        depending on their preferences. The investors must indicate the option
        in the application form. The mutual funds also allow the investors to
        change the options at a later date. Growth schemes are good for
        investors having a long-term outlook seeking appreciation over a period
        of time.
      </p>
      <h1>What are Income / Debt Oriented Scheme?</h1>
      <p>
        The aim of income funds is to provide regular and steady income to
        investors. Such schemes generally invest in fixed income securities such
        as bonds, corporate debentures, Government securities and money market
        instruments. Such funds are less risky compared to equity schemes. These
        funds are not affected because of fluctuations in equity markets.
        However, opportunities of capital appreciation are also limited in such
        funds. The NAVs of such funds are affected because of change in interest
        rates in the country. If the interest rates fall, NAVs of such funds are
        likely to increase in the short run and vice versa. However, long term
        investors may not bother about these fluctuations.
      </p>
      <h1>What is Balanced Fund?</h1>
      <p>
        The aim of balanced funds is to provide both growth and regular income
        as such schemes invest both in equities and fixed income securities in
        the proportion indicated in their offer documents. These are appropriate
        for investors looking for moderate growth. They generally invest 40-60%
        in equity and debt instruments. These funds are also affected because of
        fluctuations in share prices in the stock markets. However, NAVs of such
        funds are likely to be less volatile compared to pure equity funds.
      </p>
      <h1>What are Money Market / Liquid Fund / income funds?</h1>
      <p>
        These funds are also income funds and their aim is to provide easy
        liquidity, preservation of capital and moderate income. These schemes
        invest exclusively in safer short-term instruments such as treasury
        bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and inter-bank call
        money, government securities, etc. Returns on these schemes fluctuate
        much less compared to other funds. These funds are appropriate for
        corporate and individual investors as a means to park their surplus
        funds for short periods
      </p>
      <h1>What is Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS)?</h1>
      <p>
        Equity linked saving schemes (ELSS), these schemes are open-ended growth
        schemes with a mandatory 3-year lock- in. These schemes offer the
        benefit of section 80(C) of IT Act, up to a maximum of Rs 100,000 The
        main features of ELSS are - <br />
        Repurchase: Repurchases are permitted after a period of 3 years. <br />
        Lock-in-period: The units under ELSS are prohibited from trading,
        pledging and transfer during the lock in period of 3 years.
      </p>
      <h1>What are Index Funds?</h1>
      <p>
        Index Funds replicate the portfolio of a particular index such as the
        BSE Sensitive index, S&P NSE 50 index (Nifty), etc. These schemes invest
        in the securities in the same weightage comprising of an index. NAVs of
        such schemes would rise or fall in accordance with the rise or fall in
        the index.
      </p>
      <h1>What are sectoral specific funds?</h1>
      <p>
        These are schemes whose objective is to invest only in the equity of
        those companies existing in a specific sector, as laid down in the
        fund&apos;s offer document. For example, an FMCG sectoral fund shall invest
        in companies like HLL, Cadbury&apos;s, Nestle etc., and not in a software
        company like Infosys. Currently there exist approximately four broad
        classifications of basic sectors namely - technology, media & telecom
        (TMT), fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), basic industry (that invest in
        core industries like petrochemicals, cement, steel, etc.) and
        pharmaceuticals.
      </p>
      <h1>What is a Fund of Funds (FoF) scheme?</h1>
      <p>
        A scheme that invests primarily in other schemes of the same mutual fund
        or other mutual funds is known as a FoF scheme. A FoF scheme enables the
        investors to achieve greater diversification through one scheme. It
        spreads risks across a greater universe.
      </p>
      <h1>What is an entry load?</h1>
      <p>
        The costs of the fund management process that includes marketing and
        initial costs are charged when you enter the scheme. These charges are
        termed the entry load. It is the additional charge you pay when you join
        a scheme.
      </p>
      <h1>What is an exit load?</h1>
      <p>
        Just like entry load some funds impose a fee when you leave the scheme,
        i.e., redeem your units, called the exit load.
