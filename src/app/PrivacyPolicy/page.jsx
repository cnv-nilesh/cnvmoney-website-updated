            <p className="text-gray-500">
              {" "}
              When you sign up to become a member, you will also be asked to
              choose a password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining
              the confidentiality of your password. It is important that you
              protect it against unauthorized access of your account and
              information by choosing your password carefully, and keeping your
              password and computer secure by signing out after using our
              services <br /> You agree not to use the account, username, email
              address or password of another Member at any time or to disclose
              your password to any third party. If you choose to share this
              information with third parties to provide you additional services,
              you are responsible for all actions taken with your login
              information and password and therefore should review each third
              party{"'"}s privacy policy. You are responsible for all actions
              taken with your login information and password, including fees. If
              you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial
              control over your personally identifiable information and may be
              subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.
              Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason,
              you should immediately change your password. You agree to notify
              us immediately if you suspect any consistent unauthorized use of
              your account or access to your password even after changing it.

              {" "}
              Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy,
              this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information
              we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your
              information to other parties, whether they are on our Websites or
              on other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply
              to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to
              them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they
              adhere to their own privacy policies. Since we do not control the
              privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask
              questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

              {" "}
              We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and
              unauthorized access. We employ bank-grade security techniques to
              protect such data from unauthorized access by members inside and
              outside the company. We follow generally accepted industry
              standards to protect the personal information submitted to us,
              when we receive it. However, {"perfect security"} does not exist
              on the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches
              beyond the control of our standard security procedures are at your
              sole risk and discretion.
